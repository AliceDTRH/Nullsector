# UNIVERSAL RULES

The rules below are absolute. It is a set of fundamental principles that all players and admins should follow, no matter the context.
Players caught violating them may be banned without prior warning. This does not mean rules in the roleplay ruleset are compromisable,
only that the below are ingrained into the core rulesets ignorant of our specific roleplay standards.

  - Treat all persons fairly and with respect, to not engage in harassment or discrimination.
  - Strive such that this code is upheld by all others, including the adminship. Formally report it if discovered it had not been upheld otherwise.
  - Avoid contempt with any and all decisions made by the adminship, regardless of personal beliefs.
  - Do not evade bans.
  - Adhere to the core Roleplay Guidelines.
