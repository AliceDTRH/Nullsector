          stationDescription: 'A temporary repair orbital for Lark Station. It will be dismantled at a later time. {CAMPAIGN: Lark Station was found in ruins, and a repair team was called in. Some of the team are familiar; others, new faces. Regardless, the Lark Region was nearly destroyed in its infancy, and it remains to be seen if the repair efforts will be enough to keep it together.}'
